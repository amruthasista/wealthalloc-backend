## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Robo-advisors are expensive
- Betterment: 0.25% AUM = **$250/year** on $100K
- Wealthfront: 0.25% AUM = **$250/year** on $100K
- Personal Capital: 0.89% AUM = **$890/year** on $100K

### DIY investors are underserved
- **15 million** IBKR users have NO portfolio intelligence
- Leaving **$2,850/year** in tax savings on the table
- Manual tax loss harvesting takes **hours**

### Existing solutions use basic algorithms
- Black-box AI with no scientific validation
- Hours/days for portfolio updates
- No crisis detection

**Bottom line: Middle-class investors overpay for mediocre AI**

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

### WealthAlloc: AI Wealth Management at $9/month

**Core Features:**
- ✅ LSTM Autoencoder AI (peer-reviewed in Nature journal)
- ✅ Real-time portfolio updates (<100ms vs hours)
- ✅ Advanced tax loss harvesting (23% more accurate)
- ✅ Crisis detection (2-3 weeks early warning)
- ✅ Direct IBKR integration
- ✅ Flat $9/month pricing

**Key Differentiator:**
> "While competitors charge 0.25-1% of assets, we charge a flat $9/month.
> Our AI uses peer-reviewed science, not black-box algorithms."

## 5. PRESS RELEASE

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Michigan Startup Launches AI Wealth Management Platform at Fraction of Robo-Advisor Costs**

*WealthAlloc uses Nature-published AI to democratize sophisticated portfolio management*

ANN ARBOR, MI – [Date] – WealthAlloc, a Michigan-based fintech startup, today launched an AI-powered wealth management platform that charges $9/month compared to competitors' 0.25-1% of assets under management.

While traditional robo-advisors like Betterment and Wealthfront charge $250-$890 annually on a $100,000 portfolio, WealthAlloc's flat-fee model costs just $108 per year – a savings of 52-88%.

"Middle-class investors shouldn't have to choose between expensive advisors and doing everything manually," said [Your Name], founder of WealthAlloc. "Our AI uses peer-reviewed technology published in Nature journal to deliver institutional-grade portfolio management at a price anyone can afford."

The platform's LSTM Autoencoder technology analyzes correlations between stocks to optimize tax loss harvesting, saving users an average of $2,850 annually. WealthAlloc also features crisis detection capabilities that can alert users 2-3 weeks before market stress events.

WealthAlloc is initially launching in Michigan, targeting the state's 180,000 active investors, with plans to expand nationally in 2025.
